# LazyVStackStutter
This project demonstrates how LazyVStacks stutter within a ScrollView in SwiftUI.

In my opinion, this is the only thing that's preventing SwiftUI from being used in more complex applications. I hope that Apple will fix this, or maybe someone can point out what I'm doing wrong here.
