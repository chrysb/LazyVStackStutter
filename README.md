# LazyVStackStutter
This project demonstrates how `LazyVStack` stutters within a `ScrollView` in SwiftUI.

In my opinion, this is the only thing that's preventing SwiftUI from being used in more complex applications. I hope that Apple will fix this, or maybe someone can point out what I'm doing wrong here.

To reproduce the issue, just scroll down and then flick the ScrollView back to the top. `Shuffle items` and try again.
